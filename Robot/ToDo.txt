- FIXING the comm module
- finding out which side we are on using the beacons
	- fix beacon sensing code to measure frequencies accurately (some code is interfering)
	- then we can just use BeaconTypeDetected to know which beacon we have.
- strategy against a faster shooter bot
- timer for end of 2 mins
- make sure the beacon sensors work from the shooting position
- fix shooter friction problems
- fix beacon senser on rotating part permanently
- tiny side wall on the shooter
- Optimize code for speed (we need every edge we can get against the other shooter)
- I think the rotate to align overshoots a tiny bit
